description: >
  IRANOIL is a utility token on the TON blockchain, inspired by the
  strategic value of crude oil. With a fixed total supply of
  20,000,000,000 units (twenty billion) and 9 decimals, IRANOIL
  aims to serve as a transparent, fast, and secure foundation for
  transactions, investments, and energy-related projects within
  the Web3 ecosystem.

  50% of the total supply (10,000,000,000 tokens) has been distributed
  across 21 different wallet addresses to ensure decentralization and
  transparency. The remaining supply will be allocated to DEX liquidity,
  community incentives, and token burn events according to the roadmap.
